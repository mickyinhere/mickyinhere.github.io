<p><span style="color: #333399;" data-darkreader-inline-color=""><strong>Alice Rawsthorn</strong></span> is an award-winning design critic and author of the books Design as an Attitude and Hello World: Where Design Meets Life.</p>
<p>Born: November 15, 1958 (age 62 years), Manchester, United Kingdom</p>

<p>All of these designers and many more are pursuing their dreams, by the making the most of their newfound freedom, with the discipline of professional designers and the resourcefulness of rebels and renegades. And we all stand to benefit. </p>

<p>Now, it was the courage and verve of radical designers like Bucky and Moholy that drew me to design. I began my career as a news journalist and foreign correspondent. I wrote about politics, economics and corporate affairs, and I could have chosen to specialize in any of those fields. But I picked design, because I believe it's one of the most powerful tools at our disposal to improve our quality of life.</p>

<p>She brought up several historial people viewed as designers, such as&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <strong>Ying Zheng</strong></p>
<p>2. <strong>Edward Teach</strong>, better known as the British pirate, Blackbeard</p>
<p>3. <strong>Florence Nightingale</strong>, the 19th-century British nurse</p>
<p>4. <strong>László Moholy-Nagy</strong>,  He radicalized the Bauhaus Design School in 1920s Germany</p>
<p>5. <strong>Richard Buckminster Fuller</strong></p>

<div class="content"><p>Design is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">slippery</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">elusive</span> phenomenon.</p>
<p>rebels and renegades</p>
<p>vulnerable</p>
<p>And yet he used design <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unknowingly</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">instinctively</span> but with tremendous ingenuity to achieve his</p>
<p>And so did another equally <span style="text-decoration: underline;">improbable</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">accidental</span> designer,</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">dreamt</span> of (dream of )</p>
<p>the case <span style="text-decoration: underline;">throughout</span> history</p>
<p>through <span style="text-decoration: underline;">military conquest</span></p>
<p>terrorizing the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">high seas</span></p>
<p>they needed to attack their enemies so brutally that they would surrender <span style="text-decoration: underline;">on sight</span>.</p>
<p>incurring <span style="text-decoration: underline;">casualties</span>.</p>
<p>playing the part of a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">merciless brute</span>.</p>
<p>so they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sizzled menacingly</span> whenever his ship was poised to attack.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Colonial trade</span> was<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> flourishing</span>, and piracy was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">highly profitable</span>.</p>
<p>And the smarter pirates like him realized that to maximize their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">spoils.</span></p>
<p>he flew a flag that bore the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">macabre</span> symbols of a human skull and a pair of crossed bones, because those <span style="text-decoration: underline;">motifs </span>had <span style="text-decoration: underline;">signified</span> death in so many cultures for centuries</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Put like that</span>, it's easy to see...</p>
<p>was<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> a precursor of</span> today's logos</p>
<p>Yet design was also used to<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> nobler ends</span></p>
<p>Once there, she <span style="text-decoration: underline;">swiftly realized</span> that...</p>
<p>in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">filthy</span>,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> fetid wards</span>, than they were of battle wounds.</p>
<p>So she <span style="text-decoration: underline;">campaigned</span> for cleaner, lighter, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">airier</span> clinics to be designed and built.</p>
<p>The Nightingale ward, as it is called, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dominated</span> hospital design <span style="text-decoration: underline;">for decades to come</span></p>
<p> Ying solved this problem by insisting that all bows and arrows were designed identically, so they were interchangeable.</p>
<p> His formidably equipped army won batter after battle</p>
<p>designers who deviated from it risked being seen as cranks or subversives.</p>
<p>admittedly, some of his experiments failed</p>
<p>has provided sorely needed refuge to many, many people in desperate circumstances ever since. </p>
<p>Now, it was the courage and verve of radical designers like Bucky and Moholy that drew me to design.</p>
